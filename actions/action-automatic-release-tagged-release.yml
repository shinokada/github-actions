# Create a new GitHub release when tags are pushed to the repository
# Similar to the previous example, this workflow will kick in as soon as new tags are pushed to GitHub. After building & testing your project:

# Generate a changelog from all the commits between this and the previous semver-looking tag.
# Generate a new release and associate it with this tag.
# Upload LICENSE.txt and any jar files as release assets.
